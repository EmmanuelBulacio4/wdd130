            <p> Hello! My name is Emmanuel Bulacio and I'm from Salta, a beautiful 
                city in northen Argentina. I am marry to Rita since 2016 and we have 
                a little daughter called Amanda. <br>My wife and I served a mission in Buenos Aires and Lima respectively.
                She serve currently serves as RElief Society president and I do as a Qourum president.<br>
                We love spend time together while cooking, hang out with friends and 
                watching action movies. I am not at good watching long films because 
                I fall asleep.<br>
                Rita is studying at BYU as well but I do not remember the degree but she 
                comment to me new things and talk a lot about family issues, red flags and others 
                subjects.<br>
                In the other hand I like computers thatÂ´s why decided to study Web development.
                I had came back studying after a few years so I am getting by for the moment but I 
                know I will make it. <br>
                My little daughter loves playing with her cousins in the swimming pool
                on summer days. She likes chips and milanesas, she really loves those 
                dish so She ask for us to cook that twice a month.
                She is so cute and polite. 
            </p>
