            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Dry Oar was founded by Emmanuel Bulacio, a passionate about adventure sports.
                A pioneer in this sport in the state, he decided to take his passion further by putting
                rafting available to everyone.
                  Throughout these years we were able to improve our facilities and achieved
                  the most demanding certifications worldwide and specific insurance for adventure activities..</p>
